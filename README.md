Intro - I have been using data visualization to solve all kinds of business problems for my clients. For once, I decided to solve my own problem using my data viz skills.
Business Problem - I want a way to keep track of my net worth and diversification. None of the existing tools let me measure my net worth in a way I want to, hence I decided to build my own solution. This can be used to track the net worth of multiple people in the same dashboard. The questions I am looking to get answered:
- What's my latest net worth?
- How has my net worth changed in the past few years?
- Am I meeting my net worth targets?
- How diversified am I across my asset types?
- How has my diversification changed over time?
Data - I have an Excel sheet where I record the value of my assets every start of the month. I use this data to power the chart. Obviously the data here is random.
